Questions:
1.	What is an interface in C#?
2.	What can you define inside an interface?
3.	How can you implement an interface in a class?
4.	How are interfaces different form inheritance?
5.	Does polymorphism also apply to interfaces?
6.	What are some practical use cases for using interfaces?

Answers:

1.	An interface in C# defines a contract that classes must implement. 
	It specifies method signatures, properties, events, or indexers, but 
	does not provide any implementation.

2.	In C#, you can define the following inside an interface:
		Method Signatures: Only the declaration of methods, without		
		implementations.

		Properties: Only the getter and setter signatures, without
		implementation.

		Events: Declarations for events.

		Indexers: Declarations for indexers.

3.	Interfaces provide a way to enforce behavior across unrelated classes,
	while inheritance allows sharing both behavior and state within a 
	class hierarchy.

4.	Interfaces define behavior without implementation and allow multiple 
	inheritance.

	Inheritance allows a class to share both behavior and structure but
	is limited to a single base class.

5.	Yes, polymorphism applies to interfaces in C#. Polymorphism allows 
	objects to be treated as instances of their base type, enabling 
	methods to be called on them dynamically at runtime.

6.	Defining contracts: Ensure classes implement specific methods.
	Decoupling: Allow for modular code with interchangeable implementations.
	Dependency injection: Inject different implementations at runtime.
	Polymorphism: Treat objects uniformly when they implement the same interface.
	Testing: Easily mock dependencies in unit tests.
	Event handling: Standardize event handling across different classes.
	Plugin architecture: Enable dynamic plugins by defining common interfaces.
