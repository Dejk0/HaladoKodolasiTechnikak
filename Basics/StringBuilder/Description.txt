Questions:

1. What is a StringBuilder in C#?
2. How does a StringBuilder differ from a regular string in C#?
3. What are the benefits of using a StringBuilder for string manipulation?

Answers:

1. A StringBuilder in C# is a mutable string object that allows you to efficiently
   build and manipulate strings. It provides methods for appending, inserting,
   replacing, and removing characters in a string without creating new string
   objects each time.

2. A StringBuilder differs from a regular string in C# in that strings are immutable,
   meaning they cannot be changed once created. When you modify a string, a new
   string object is created in memory, which can be inefficient for large string
   manipulations. StringBuilder, on the other hand, allows you to modify the
   contents of a string without creating new objects, making it more efficient
   for string manipulation operations.

3. The benefits of using a StringBuilder for string manipulation include:
   - Improved performance: StringBuilder allows you to modify strings in place
	 without creating new objects, reducing memory overhead and improving
	 performance for large string manipulations.
   - Efficient memory usage: By reusing the same StringBuilder object for
	 multiple string operations, you can avoid unnecessary memory allocations
	 and deallocations, leading to more efficient memory usage.
   - Flexibility: StringBuilder provides a wide range of methods for appending,
	 inserting, replacing, and removing characters in a string, giving you
	 flexibility in how you manipulate strings in your code.
   - Readability: Using StringBuilder can make your code more readable and
	 maintainable by clearly separating string manipulation operations from
	 other logic in your code.
