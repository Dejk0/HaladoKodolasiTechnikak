Answers:

1. A Namespace in C# is a way to organize and group related classes, interfaces, 
   structs, enums, and other types into a logical hierarchy. Namespaces help 
   prevent naming conflicts and make it easier to manage and maintain large 
   codebases by providing a way to partition code into distinct sections.

2. You should create a new Namespace when you have a set of related types that 
   serve a common purpose or belong to a specific module or component of your 
   application. This helps keep your code organized, maintainable, and easier 
   to understand by grouping related types together.

3. A namespace alias in C# is a way to provide a shorter or more convenient name 
   for a namespace in your code. This can be useful when working with long or 
   nested namespaces to reduce the amount of typing required to reference types 
   within that namespace. You can define a namespace alias using the using keyword 
   followed by an alias and the namespace name, like using Alias = NamespaceName;.

4. While it is not strictly required to define a namespace for all your code,
   it is considered a best practice to use namespaces to organize and structure 
   your codebase. This helps prevent naming conflicts, makes it easier to locate 
   and reference types, and provides a clear hierarchy for your code.

5. The using keyword in C# is used to import namespaces into your code file,
   allowing you to reference types within those namespaces without fully 
   qualifying the type names. This can help reduce the amount of typing required 
   to access types and make your code more readable. You can use the using 
   directive at the top of your code file to import namespaces, like using 
   System; to import the System namespace.
