Questions:
1.	What is Stack and a Queue in C#?
2.	How do you add and remove items form a Stack?
3.	How do you add and remove items form a Queue?
4.	Can a List do the some thing as a Stack and Queue?
5.	What is Hashset?
6.	What is a SortedList in C#?

Answers:
1.	Stack: A collection that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
	Queue: A collection that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

2.	code.
3.	code.
4.	Yes, a List can be used as a Stack or Queue, but it’s not as 
	efficient as using the dedicated Stack or Queue classes.
5.	A HashSet in C# is a collection that stores unique elements without any 
	specific order. It uses hashing for fast lookups and ensures no duplicate values are added.
		Key Features:
		Unique Elements: Does not allow duplicates.
		Unordered: Elements are not stored in a specific order.
		Fast Lookup: Offers O(1) average time complexity for adding, checking existence, and removing elements.

6.	A SortedList in C# is a collection that stores key-value pairs in sorted order by 
	the keys. It combines the functionality of a Dictionary with automatic sorting of keys.
		Key Features:
		Sorted by Key: Automatically sorts the elements by the keys.
		Key-Value Pairs: Stores data as key-value pairs.
		Efficient Lookup: Provides O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.
