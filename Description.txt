Question:	

1. What is a Stack and a Queue in C#?
2. How do you add and remove items from a Stack and a Queue?
3. Can a List do the same thing as a Stack and a Queue?
4. What is a HasSet inc C#?
5. What is ShortedList in C#?

Answer:

1.  Stack and Queue are two types of collections in C#. Stack is 
	a collection of objects that supports LIFO (Last In First 
	Out) and Queue is a collection of objects that supports 
	FIFO (First In First Out).

2.  To add an item to a Stack, you can use the Push() method and 
	to remove an item from a Stack, you can use the Pop() method. 
	To add an item to a Queue, you can use the Enqueue() method 
	and to remove an item from a Queue, you can use the Dequeue() 
	method.

3.  Yes, a List can do the same thing as a Stack and a Queue.
	To add an item to a List, you can use the Add() method and 
	to remove an item from a List, you can use the Remove() 
	method. However, a List does not have the same performance 
	characteristics as a Stack or a Queue.

4.	HashSet is a collection of unique objects in C#. It does not 
	allow duplicate elements.

5.  SortedList is a collection of key/value pairs that are sorted 
	by the keys. It is similar to a Dictionary but maintains the 
	elements in sorted order based on the keys.
