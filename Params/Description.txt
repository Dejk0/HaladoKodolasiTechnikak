Questions:
1.	What is the params keyword in C#, and how dos it works?
2.	What is an example of params being used?
3.	What are the requirements for using the params keyword in a function?
4.	Is the array passaed to a params paramater ever null, or 
	is it always instantiated even if no armunets are passed?

Answers:
1.	The params keyword in C# allows a method to accept a variable 
	number of arguments of the same type, enabling flexibility in how
	you call the method. It treats the arguments as an array.
	How it works:
		It must be the last parameter in the method signature.
		You can pass a comma-separated list of values or an array of the specified type
2.	code.
3.	Last Parameter: The params parameter must be the last parameter
	in the method's signature. You cannot have another parameter after it.

	Array Type: The parameter must be an array (e.g., params int[], params string[], etc.). 
	This array will hold all the arguments passed to the method.

	Same Type: The arguments passed via params must be of 
	the same type as the array element type.

4.	When using the params keyword in C#, if no arguments are passed to the method, 
	the array parameter will never be null. Instead, it is automatically 
	instantiated as an empty array.
