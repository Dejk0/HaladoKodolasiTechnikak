Questions:
1.	What is a nested loop?
2.	Can you nest different loop types?
3.	Show me an example of how nested loops work with multidimensional arrays?
4.	How does the scope of the cariables work with nested loops?
5.	How do the break and continue keywords work within nested loops?
6.	Does break; stop executing of every nested loops?
7.	what are some possible porblems with nested loops?

Answers:

1.	A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. The inner loop runs completely 
	for each iteration of the outer loop.
2.	Yes, I can nest different loop types in C#. For example, 
	a for loop can be nested inside a while loop, or vice versa.
3.	code

4.	Outer Loop Variables: Accessible in both outer and inner loops.
	Inner Loop Variables: Limited to the inner loop's scope.

5.	In nested loops, the break and continue keywords affect only the loop where they are called:
	break: Exits the current loop immediately.
	continue: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the same loop.

6.	No, break only exits the loop in which it is called. It does not stop the execution
	of all nested loops. To stop all nested loops, you need additional logic, 
	like using flags, exceptions, or labels.

7.	Performance: Can lead to high time complexity (e.g., O(n²)).
	Readability: Deep nesting makes code harder to understand.
	Logical Errors: Misuse of break or conditions may cause bugs.
	Redundancy: May repeat unnecessary computations.
	Memory Overhead: Large datasets can consume excessive memory.
